The entirety of appz is packaged and shipped as a single binary. It works on all major operating systems, and does not require any external dependencies. For convenience, we provide the following scripts to download and install appz.


## Linux, macOS, WSL

In a terminal that supports Bash, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.youappz.com/install.sh | bash
```

This will install appz to ~/.appz/bin. You'll then need to set PATH manually in your shell profile.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.appz/bin:$PATH"
```

## Windows
In Powershell or Windows Terminal, run:

```bash
irm https://get.youappz.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

This will install appz to ~\.appz\bin and prepend to the PATH environment variable for the current session. To persist across sessions, update PATH manually in your system environment variables.

## Upgrading
appz can be upgraded with the appz upgrade command. However, this will only upgrade appz if it was installed in ~/.appz/bin.

```bash
appz upgrade
```

Otherwise, you can re-run the installers above and it will download, install, and overwrite with the latest version
