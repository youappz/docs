When running appz in a directory for the first time, Appz CLI needs to know which scope and Appz Project you want to deploy your directory to. You can choose to either link an existing Appz Project or to create a new one.


```bash terminal

appz
? Set up and deploy "~/web/my-lovely-project"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? My Awesome Team
? Link to existing project? [y/N] y
? Whatâ€™s the name of your existing project? my-lovely-project
ðŸ”— Linked to awesome-team/my-lovely-project (created .appz and added it to .gitignore)
```

Once set up, a new .appz directory will be added to your directory. The .appz directory contains both the organization and id of your Appz Project. If you want unlink your directory, you can remove the .appz directory.

You can use the --yes option to skip these questions.

## Framework detection
When you create a new Appz Project, Appz CLI will link the Appz Project and automatically detect the framework you are using and offer default Project Settings accordingly.

```bash terminal

appz
? Set up and deploy "~/web/my-new-project"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? My Awesome Team
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? Whatâ€™s your projectâ€™s name? my-new-project
? In which directory is your code located? my-new-project/
Auto-detected project settings (Next.js):
- Build Command: \`next build\` or \`build\` from \`package.json\`
- Output Directory: Next.js default
- Development Command: next dev --port $PORT
? Want to override the settings? [y/N]
Creating a new Appz Project with the appz command.
```

You will be provided with default **Build Command**, **Output Directory**, and **Development Command** options.

You can continue with the default Project Settings or overwrite them. You can also edit your Project Settings later in your Appz Project dashboard.
