When running vercel in a directory for the first time, Vercel CLI needs to know which scope and Vercel Project you want to deploy your directory to. You can choose to either link an existing Vercel Project or to create a new one.


```bash terminal

vercel
? Set up and deploy "~/web/my-lovely-project"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? My Awesome Team
? Link to existing project? [y/N] y
? Whatâ€™s the name of your existing project? my-lovely-project
ðŸ”— Linked to awesome-team/my-lovely-project (created .vercel and added it to .gitignore)
```

Once set up, a new .vercel directory will be added to your directory. The .vercel directory contains both the organization and id of your Vercel Project. If you want unlink your directory, you can remove the .vercel directory.

You can use the --yes option to skip these questions.

## Framework detection
When you create a new Vercel Project, Vercel CLI will link the Vercel Project and automatically detect the framework you are using and offer default Project Settings accordingly.

```bash terminal

vercel
? Set up and deploy "~/web/my-new-project"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? My Awesome Team
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? Whatâ€™s your projectâ€™s name? my-new-project
? In which directory is your code located? my-new-project/
Auto-detected project settings (Next.js):
- Build Command: \`next build\` or \`build\` from \`package.json\`
- Output Directory: Next.js default
- Development Command: next dev --port $PORT
? Want to override the settings? [y/N]
Creating a new Vercel Project with the vercel command.
```

You will be provided with default Build Command, Output Directory, and Development Command options.

You can continue with the default Project Settings or overwrite them. You can also edit your Project Settings later in your Vercel Project dashboard.
