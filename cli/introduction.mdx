Learn how to use the Appz command-line interface (CLI) to manage and configure your Appz Projects from the command line.

Appz gives you multiple ways to interact with and configure your Appz Projects. With the command-line interface (CLI) you can interact with the Appz platform using a terminal, or through an automated system, enabling you to retrieve logs, manage certificates, replicate your deployment environment locally, manage Domain Name System (DNS) records, and more.

If you'd like to interface with the platform programmatically, check out the REST API documentation.



## Using in a CI/CD environment

Appz CLI requires you to log in and authenticate before accessing resources or performing administrative tasks. In a terminal environment, you can use appz login, which requires manual input. In a CI/CD environment where manual input is not possible, you can create a token on your tokens page and then use the --token option to authenticate.
