import { GlobalOptionsComponent } from '/snippets/global-options.mdx'

Deployments can also be removed from the Project Overview page on the Appz Dashboard.

## Usage
```bash terminal
appz remove [deployment-url]
```
>   Executing the `appz remove` command to delete a deployment from the Appz platform.

## Extended Usage
```bash terminal
appz remove [deployment-url-1 deployment-url-2]
```

>   Using the `appz remove` command to delete multiple deployments from the Appz platform.

```bash terminal
appz remove [project-name]
```
>   Using the `appz remove` command to delete all deployments for an Appz Project from the Appz platform.

Using the project name will result in the removal of the entire Appz Project from the current scope unless the `--safe` option is used.

## Unique Options
These options are specific to the appz remove command.

### Safe
The `--safe` option, abbreviated `-s`, allows you to omit the removal of deployments that have an active preview URL or production domain when a project name is specified.

```bash terminal
appz remove my-project --safe
```
>   Executing the appz remove command with the --safe option.

### Yes
The `--yes` option, shorthand `-y`, can be used to bypass the confirmation step for removing a deployment or Appz Project.

```bash terminal
appz remove my-deployment.com --yes
```
>   Using the appz remove command with the --yes option.
