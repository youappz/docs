Learn how to deploy your Appz projects using the `appz deploy` CLI command. The `appz deploy` command deploys Appz projects and can be executed from the project's root directory or by specifying a path. The command appz operates without needing the 'deploy' subcommand. This document will use 'appz' to refer to appz deploy.

Usage
```bash terminal
appz
```
>   Using the `appz` command from the root of an Appz project directory.

## Extended Usage

```bash terminal
appz  --cwd [path-to-project]
```
>   Using the `appz` command and supplying a path to the root directory of the Appz project.

```bash terminal
appz deploy --prebuilt
```

>   Using the `appz` command to deploy a prebuilt Appz project, typically with `appz build`. See [appz build](/cli/commands/build) for more details.

## Standard Output Usage
When deploying, stdout is always the Deployment URL.

```bash terminal
appz > deployment-url.txt
```
>   Using the `appz` command to deploy and write stdout to a text file.

### Deploying to a Custom Domain
Example bash script for a CI/CD workflow to alias all preview deployments to a custom domain. Note that defining the scope may be necessary when using appz alias.

```bash deployDomain.sh
# save stdout and stderr to files
appz deploy >deployment-url.txt 2>error.txt
 
# check the exit code
code=$?
if [ $code -eq 0 ]; then
    # Use the deployment url from stdout for the next step of your workflow
    deploymentUrl=$(cat deployment-url.txt)
    appz alias $deploymentUrl my-custom-domain.com
else
    # Handle the error
    errorMessage=$(cat error.txt)
    echo "There was an error: $errorMessage"
fi
```
>   The script deploys your project and assigns the deployment URL saved in stdout to the custom domain using `appz alias`.

## Standard Error Usage
 Example script to check for errors during deployment, useful in CI/CD workflows:

```bash checkDeploy.sh
# save stdout and stderr to files
appz deploy >deployment-url.txt 2>error.txt
 
# check the exit code
code=$?
if [ $code -eq 0 ]; then
    deploymentUrl=$(cat deployment-url.txt)
    echo $deploymentUrl
else
    errorMessage=$(cat error.txt)
    echo "There was an error: $errorMessage"
fi
```

## Unique Options
These options only apply to the `appz` command.

### Build Env
```bash terminal
appz --build-env KEY1=value1 --build-env KEY2=value2
```
>   Using the `appz` command with the `--build-env` option.

### Yes
```bash terminal
appz --yes
```
>   Using the `appz` command with the `--yes` option to skip questions when setting up a new Appz project.

### Env
```bash terminal
appz --env KEY1=value1 --env KEY2=value2
```
>   Using the `appz` command with the `--env` option to provide runtime environment variables.

### Prod
```bash terminal
appz --prod
```
>   Using the `appz` command with the `--prod` option to create a deployment for a production domain specified in the Appz project dashboard.

### Skip Domain
```bash terminal
appz --prod --skip-domain
```
>   Using the `appz` command with the `--skip-domain` option to disable the automatic promotion of relevant domains to a new production deployment.

### No Wait
```bash terminal
appz --no-wait
```
>   Using the `appz` command with the `--no-wait` option to not wait for a deployment to finish before exiting.
