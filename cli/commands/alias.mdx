---

The appz alias command allows you to apply custom domains to your deployments.

When a new deployment is created (with our Git Integration, Appz CLI, or the REST API), the platform will automatically apply any custom domains configured in the project settings.

Any custom domain that doesn't have a custom preview branch configured (there can only be one Production Branch and it's configured separately in the project settings) will be applied to production deployments created through any of the available sources.

Custom domains that do have a custom preview branch configured, however, only get applied when using the Git Integration.

If you're not using the Git Integration, appz alias is a great solution if you still need to apply custom domains based on Git branches, or other heuristics.

## Preferred production commands
The appz alias command is not the recommended way to promote production deployments to specific domains. Instead, you can use the following commands:

-   **`appz --prod --skip-domain`**: Use to skip custom domain assignment when deploying to production and creating a staged deployment
-   **`appz promote [deployment-id or url]`**: Use to promote your staged deployment to your custom domains
-   **`appz rollback [deployment-id or url]`**: Use to alias an earlier production deployment to your custom domains

## Usage

In general, the command allows for assigning custom domains to any deployment.

Make sure to not include the HTTP protocol (e.g. https://) for the [custom-domain] parameter.

> Using the appz alias command to assign a custom domain to a deployment.
```bash
appz alias set [deployment-url] [custom-domain]
```

> Using the appz alias command to remove a custom domain from a deployment.
```bash
appz alias rm [custom-domain]
```

> Using the appz alias command to list custom domains that were assigned to deployments.
```bash
appz alias ls
```

## Unique options
These are options that only apply to the appz alias command.

Yes
The --yes option can be used to bypass the confirmation prompt when removing an alias.

> Using the appz alias rm command with the --yes option.
```bash
appz alias rm [custom-domain] --yes
```

## Limit
The --limit option can be used to specify the maximum number of aliases returned when using ls. The default value is 20 and the maximum is 100.

```bash
appz alias ls --limit 100
```
