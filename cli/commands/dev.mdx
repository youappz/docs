The `appz dev` command enables you to simulate the Appz deployment setting right in your local environment.

Should the Development Command be set in your Project Settings, it will influence the behavior of `appz dev` for everyone in your team.


## Usage
```bash terminal
appz dev
```
>   Run the appz dev command from the root directory of an Appz Project.

## Unique Options
These options are specific to the `appz dev` command only.

### Listen
Use the `--listen` option (short form -l) to define which port `appz dev` should operate on.

```bash terminal
appz dev --listen 5005
```
>   Running the appz dev command with the `--listen` option.

### Yes
The `--yes` option helps bypass prompts when initiating a new Appz Project, automatically using the default scope and current directory for the Appz Project's name and location.

```bash terminal
appz dev --yes
```
>   Running the appz dev command with the `--yes` option.
