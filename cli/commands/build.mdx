The `appz build` command facilitates the building of an Appz Project either locally or in your own CI setup. The generated build artifacts are stored in the `.appz/output` directory in accordance with the Build Output API.

Using this in tandem with the `appz deploy --prebuilt` command allows for an Appz Deployment to be initiated without disclosing the source code of the Appz Project to Appz.

This command is also useful for troubleshooting an Appz Project by generating error messages for a failed local build, or by analyzing the build artifacts to understand better how Appz will handle the Deployment.

It's advisable to execute the `appz pull` command before running `appz build` to make sure the latest Project Settings and Environment Variables are downloaded locally.

## Usage
```bash terminal
appz build
```
> Use the `appz build` command for constructing an Appz Project.

## Unique Options
These are specific options that apply only to the `appz build` command.

### Production
The `--prod` flag should be used when you aim to build the Appz Project with Production Environment Variables. By default, the Preview Environment Variables are applied.

```bash terminal
appz build --prod
```
> Building an Appz Project using the `--prod` flag.

### Yes
The `--yes` option allows you to skip the confirmation step and directly fetch environment variables and Project Settings if they are missing locally.

```bash terminal
appz build --yes
```
>   Executing the appz build command with the `--yes` option.
