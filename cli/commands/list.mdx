The `appz list` command, which can be shortened to `appz ls`, provides a list of recent deployments for the currently-linked Appz Project.

## Usage
```bash terminal
appz list
```
>   Executing the `appz list` command to retrieve information about multiple deployments for the currently-linked Appz Project.

## Extended Usage
```bash terminal
appz list [project-name]
```
>   Using the `appz list` command to retrieve information about deployments for a specific Appz Project.

```bash terminal
appz list [project-name] [--meta foo=bar]
```
>   Using the `appz list` command to retrieve information about deployments filtered by metadata.

## Unique Options
These options are specific to the `appz list` command.

### Meta
The `--meta` option, abbreviated as `-m`, allows filtering results based on Appz Project metadata.

```bash terminal
appz list --meta key1=value1 key2=value2
```
>   Using the `appz list` command with the `--meta` option.

### Yes
The `--yes` option can be used to bypass questions when setting up a new Appz Project. The questions will be automatically answered using the default scope and the current directory for the Appz Project name and location.

```bash terminal
appz list --yes
```
>   Using the `appz list` command with the `--yes` option.
