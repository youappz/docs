The `appz rollback` command is utilized to revert production deployments to earlier ones.

## Usage
```bash terminal
appz rollback
```
>   Executing appz rollback retrieves the status of any ongoing rollbacks.

```bash terminal
appz rollback [deployment-id or url]
```
>   Using appz rollback to revert to a previous deployment.

## Unique Options
These options are exclusive to the appz rollback command.

### Timeout
The `--timeout` option dictates how long the appz rollback command will wait for the rollback to finalize. It does not influence the actual rollback process, which will continue regardless.

A timeout setting of 0 means that the command will exit immediately after initiating the rollback.

```bash terminal
appz rollback https://example-app-6vd6bhoqt.appz.dev
```
>   Using the appz rollback command on the deployment at https://example-app-6vd6bhoqt.appz.dev.
