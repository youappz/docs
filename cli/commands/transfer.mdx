Projects can be transferred between plans as long as the project owner is a member of both the source and destination teams. For instance, a project can be transferred from a personal account(Lite) to an Pro account, and vice versa.

To initiate a transfer, you must be an owner of the team you're transferring from and a member of the team you're transferring to. For example, you can transfer a project from your personal account(Lite) to an Pro team account, and vice versa, provided you're an owner on the Pro team.

During the transfer process, all of the projectâ€™s dependencies will be seamlessly moved or copied over to the new Appz Team namespace without any downtime.


```bash terminal
appz transfer
```

<GlobalOptionsComponent command={'appz transfer'} />
