The `appz pull` command is used to store Environment Variables and Project Settings in a local cache (under .appz/.env.$target.local) for offline use of `appz build` and `appz dev`. If you aren't using those commands, you don't need to run `appz pull`.

When environment variables or project settings are updated on Appz, remember to use `appz pull` again to update your local environment variable and project settings values under .appz/.

To download Environment Variables to a specific file (like .env), use `appz env pull` instead.

## Usage
