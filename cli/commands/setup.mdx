The `appz setup` command can be used to setup the developer and pipeline environments. It achieves this by downloading and installing all configured tools into the toolchain.

```bash terminal
appz setup
```

<Info>This command should rarely be used, as the environment is automatically setup when running other commands, like `appz dev` `appz-build` `appz-deploy`.</Info>
