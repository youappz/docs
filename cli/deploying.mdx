Deploying from source
The appz command is used to deploy Appz Projects and can be used from either the root of the Appz Project directory or by providing a path.

```bash
appz
```
<Info>
  Deploys the current Appz project, when run from the Appz Project root.
</Info>


You can alternatively use the appz deploy command for the same effect, if you want to be more explicit.

```bash
appz [path-to-project]
```

<Info>
  Deploys the Appz project found at the provided path, when it's a Appz Project root.
</Info>

When deploying, stdout is always the Deployment URL.

```bash
appz > deployment-url.txt
```
<Info>
Writes the Deployment URL output from the deploy command to a text file.
</Info>

## Deploying a staged production build
By default, when you promote a deployment to production, your domain will point to that deployment. If you want to create a production deployment without assigning it to your domain, for example to avoid sending all of your traffic to it, you can:

1. Turn off the auto-assignment of domains for the current production deployment:

```bash
appz --prod --skip-domain
```

2. When you are ready, manually promote the staged deployment to production:

```bash
appz promote [deployment-id or url]
```

- [deploy](/cli/commands/deploy)


## Deploying from local build (prebuilt)
You can build Appz projects locally to inspect the build outputs before they are deployed.

It's also useful for debugging build outputs.

```bash
appz build
```

Using the appz command to deploy and write stdout to a text file.

This produces .appz/output in the Build Output API format. You can review the output, then deploy with:

```bash
appz deploy --prebuilt
```

Deploy the build outputs in .appz/output produced by appz build.
