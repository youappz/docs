Setting up a webhook with Appz is a straightforward process that enables you to automatically send form submission data to other applications and services. Here’s how you can configure a webhook for your form on Appz:


<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Log in to your Appz account and navigate to the [dashboard](https://console.youappz.com). Select the form endpoint you wish to configure with a webhook.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Automation Settings">
    Go to the [Automation](https://console.youappz.com/forms/automation) page and look for the "Send Webhook Request" action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Webhook URL">
    Enter the URL of the webhook where you want the form submission data to be sent. This is the endpoint that will receive the JSON data from your form.
    Click "Complete" to finalize the URL setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your Automation">
    Make sure to click "Save Changes" to preserve your automation settings.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Test Your Webhook:">
    Once you have set up and saved your webhook, it’s ready to transmit data. Here's what happens next:
    
    Submit a new entry through your form to test the webhook. The data should be posted automatically to the URL you specified, showing up in the format you have configured.

    Check the endpoint or the service you are using to capture the webhook data (such as webhook.site) to see the incoming submissions in real time.
