## What is a Webhook?
A webhook, sometimes known as a web callback or "Reverse APIs," serves as a method for apps to provide real-time information to other applications. It acts as a mechanism allowing a server-side application to notify a client-side application when a new event has occurred on the server.

The efficiency of webhooks benefits both the provider and the consumer. The primary challenge with webhooks can often be their setup process.

Webhooks are typically employed to link two different applications. When an event occurs in the triggering application, it serializes the event data and sends it to a webhook URL of the action application â€” the one you wish to react based on the data from the first application.

## When to Use a Webhook?
Webhooks are ideal for executing smaller requests and tasks, and there are specific scenarios where using a webhook is more appropriate than using an entire API.

**Real-time Updates:** If your application or platform requires instant updates, webhooks are highly effective. They provide real-time data without consuming excessive resources.

**Limited or No API Availability:** In situations where the available API is inadequate or non-existent, a webhook provides a feasible alternative solution. It allows you to obtain the necessary data for your application to function effectively.
